## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vinny! I am currently a Junior in High School. I've been programming since 2022 in a variety of languages. I've partaken in Hyland's annual hackathon as well as an online CTF (4T$) which we came 37/200+ teams!

## My Projects
- Created a Password Manager in Rust
    - uses AES-256 in CBC operation mode
    - uses sha256 to confirm login before entering password manager
    - uses egui for a simple gui
- Created a Music Player in Python
    - supports playlists, adding and removing songs, changing volume, skip, pause, and more
    - converts YouTube links into .wav files
    - asynchronously plays songs in the background
- Created a Flashcard Wesbite for AQT
    - converts pdfs into json objects using Python and Pdfreader
    - uses js to generate flash cards on frontend
    - supports themes, basic filtering, shuffling, forward and backwards, cookies, etc
- and more! 

## Current Projects
- Creating a POSIX compliant shell (inspired by fish) in C++. Ideally, it should be a drop in replacement for Bash (with fish features, such as autocomplete), but that's very optimistic of me.
- a blog website
- an eportfolio to showcase my work!
